# AIO_2024_note
This repository is a collection of notes and resources for the AIO 2024 course. The notes are organized by module, and each module contains lecture notes, exercises, and other relevant materials. 

**Disclaimer**: This is not a reflection of the entire course. I only created notes for points that I found interesting or useful during exams/interviews. Furthermore, some notes were jotted down with my own understanding, and may not have been properly cross-checked. This repository is a work in progress and will be updated as I continue to learn and explore the topics covered in and beyond the course. The notes are intended to be a helpful resource for anyone interested in learning more about the course material.

The Markdown notes are optimized to render with KaTeX. 

Please check out the [AI Viet Nam](https://www.facebook.com/aivietnam.edu.vn) website for more information about the course.
