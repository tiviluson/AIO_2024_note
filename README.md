# AIO_2024_note
This repository is a collection of notes and resources for the AIO 2024 course. The notes are organized by module, and each module contains lecture notes, exercises, and other relevant materials.  

Disclaimer: I only created notes for points that I found interesting or useful during exams/interviews, so this is not a reflection of the entire course.  


Please check out the [AIVN](https://aivnlearning.edu.vn/) website for more information about the course.
